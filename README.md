To run this program, run `python app.py` from the terminal, while
 in the same directory as the Udacity `news` database.

You must be using Python 2.6 or 2.7 as some of the import statements and
syntax assume Python 2.6 or higher.

The app will handle connecting to the local `news` database for you,
 running the predefined query, and formatting the results nicely as text.

The app supports adding your own queries as menu options to the python file.
